Solar Cycle 25 began in December 2019. It is tracking above initial predictions
and is relevant to every propagation measurement in this dataset — the higher
the sunspot number, the more favorable conditions on the upper HF bands.

This page tracks cycle position using monthly SSN and SFI averaged from
`solar.bronze` (GFZ Potsdam / SIDC data, backfilled to 2000).

Solar Cycle 25 began in December 2019 and is tracking well above NOAA's initial
prediction of SSN 137. The current phase of high solar activity benefits
upper HF bands (10m–17m) by raising the Maximum Usable Frequency.
