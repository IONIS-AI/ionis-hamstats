Solar Cycle 25 began in December 2019. It is tracking above initial predictions
and is relevant to every propagation measurement in this dataset — the higher
the sunspot number, the more favorable conditions on the upper HF bands.

This page tracks cycle position using monthly SSN and SFI averaged from
`solar.bronze` (GFZ Potsdam / SIDC data, backfilled to 2000).

## Monthly SSN and SFI — Solar Cycle 25

*Monthly averages from `solar.bronze`. Smoothed SSN uses a 13-month
centered running mean.*

## Cycle 24 vs Cycle 25 Comparison

Month-by-month comparison at the same point in each cycle. Cycle 24 peaked at
SSN ~116 (April 2014). Cycle 25 comparison starts from December 2019.

| Months Into Cycle | Cycle 24 SSN | Cycle 25 SSN | Cycle 25 Ahead/Behind |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|

## IONIS Prediction Accuracy Over the Cycle

Pearson correlation between IONIS predictions and measured WSPR SNR, grouped
by 6-month intervals. Higher solar activity generally improves prediction
accuracy on upper bands.

| Period | Avg SSN | IONIS Pearson | RMSE (sigma) | Sample Count |
