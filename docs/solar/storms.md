# Storm Impact Analysis

This page shows measured SNR degradation during geomagnetic storms. All values
come from actual signal measurements — WSPR, RBN, and PSK Reporter spots
collected during storm events — joined against Kp index at 3-hour resolution.

A geomagnetic storm is defined here as Kp >= 5, sustained for at least 3 hours.
SNR before/during/after is the median across all recorded spots on each band
during the respective window.

## SNR Before / During / After — Most Recent Storm

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: SNR comparison table for most recent storm -->

*Median SNR (dB) measured from WSPR spots in the 24-hour window before,
during, and 24-hour window after peak Kp.*

## Recovery Timeline

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: recovery timeline table -->

Hours after peak Kp until median SNR returns to within 1 dB of pre-storm
baseline, by band. Averaged across all storms in the dataset where Kp >= 5.
