## 7-Day Kp Trend

Daily maximum Kp over the past 7 days. Values >= 5 indicate geomagnetic storm
conditions — see [Storm Impact](storms.md) for measured SNR effects.

| Date | Max Kp | Storm Level | HF Impact |

## Current Band Impact Assessment

Estimated propagation impact based on current SFI and Kp, derived from
measured historical correlations in the IONIS dataset — not modeled
predictions.

| Band | SFI Effect | Kp Effect | Net Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 10m (28 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 12m (24.9 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 15m (21 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 17m (18.1 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 20m (14 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 30m (10.1 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 40m (7 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 80m (3.5 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 160m (1.8 MHz) | — | — | — |

*Assessment is based on measured SNR correlations across 10.8B WSPR spots and
2.18B RBN spots. Higher bands respond more strongly to SFI. Lower bands
are more sensitive to geomagnetic disturbance.*
