# Current Solar Conditions

Solar indices sourced from NOAA SWPC (`wspr.live_conditions`) updated every 15
minutes. SFI is published once daily (~20:00 UTC from Penticton, BC). Kp is
updated every 3 hours.

## 7-Day Kp Trend

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: 7-day Kp trend table -->

Daily maximum Kp over the past 7 days. Values >= 5 indicate geomagnetic storm
conditions — see [Storm Impact](storms.md) for measured SNR effects.

| Date | Max Kp | Storm Level | HF Impact |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 2026-02-13 | 4.00 | Unsettled | Minor |
| 2026-02-14 | 4.33 | Active | Moderate |
| 2026-02-15 | 5.33 | G1 Storm | Degraded |
| 2026-02-16 | 6.00 | G2 Storm | Significant |
| 2026-02-17 | 3.00 | Quiet | Normal |
| 2026-02-18 | 3.33 | Unsettled | Minor |
| 2026-02-19 | 3.33 | Unsettled | Minor |

## Current Band Impact Assessment

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: band impact by solar conditions -->

Estimated propagation impact based on current SFI and Kp, derived from
measured historical correlations in the IONIS dataset — not modeled
predictions.

| Band | SFI Effect | Kp Effect | Net Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 10m (28 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 12m (24.9 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 15m (21 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 17m (18.1 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 20m (14 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 30m (10.1 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 40m (7 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 80m (3.5 MHz) | — | — | — |
| 160m (1.8 MHz) | — | — | — |

*Assessment is based on measured SNR correlations across 10.8B WSPR spots and
2.18B RBN spots. Higher bands respond more strongly to SFI. Lower bands
are more sensitive to geomagnetic disturbance.*
