# Contest Recaps

During major HF contest weekends, spot volume across all sources spikes
dramatically. Operators run high power on all bands for 24–48 hours. The RBN
skimmer network processes millions of CW and RTTY exchanges. The result is a
compressed snapshot of global HF propagation at high activity — every path
that can support a QSO gets tested.

This section publishes post-contest recaps: spot volume, band activity, solar
conditions during the event, geographic reach, and comparison to prior years.

## Next Recap

*No recap available yet. Check back after the next major contest weekend.*

The recap will include:

- Total spot volume by source (WSPR, RBN, PSKR) vs 24-hour baseline
- Band-by-band activity comparison (spots per hour over the contest window)
- Solar conditions (SFI, Kp, SSN) during the event
- Geographic heatmap of activity (unique grid pairs active)
- Year-over-year comparison for the same contest
- Notable propagation events (unexpected openings, shutdowns)

## What Contest Data Shows

A contest recap is a propagation stress test. Tens of thousands of operators
run simultaneously on all bands with consistent power and timing. When 20m
goes long, you see it in the RBN spot latitudes. When 10m opens to a new
region, the spot map shows it within minutes.

The contest database (`contest.bronze`, 195M QSOs) is the historical record.
Recaps draw from it to place current events in context.
