# Ham Stats

**HF propagation reports generated from real data — not models, not opinions.**

Every number on this site comes from measured amateur radio observations: WSPR
beacons, Reverse Beacon Network skimmers, PSK Reporter decodes, and contest
logs. Solar conditions are correlated with actual signal measurements, not
theoretical predictions.

## Current Conditions

{% set solar = data.solar_current[0] if data.solar_current else {} %}
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **SFI** | {{ solar.solar_flux | default('—') }} | {{ solar.solar_flux | classify_sfi }} |
| **Kp** | {{ solar.kp_index | default('—') }} | {{ solar.kp_index | classify_kp }} |
| **Conditions** | {{ solar.conditions | default('—') }} | Normal propagation |

*Updated every 3 hours from NOAA SWPC via ClickHouse.*

## IONIS Predictions — KI7MT (DN26) Contest Paths

*V20 model predictions for the current solar conditions (SFI {{ sfi | default('—') }}, Kp {{ kp | default('—') }}).
Which bands can work which continents right now?*

{% for dest in predictions %}
| {{ dest.label }} | {{ dest.bands["10m"] }} | {{ dest.bands["15m"] }} | {{ dest.bands["20m"] }} | {{ dest.bands["40m"] }} |
{% endfor %}

*Mode thresholds: SSB &ge; +3 dB, RTTY &ge; -5 dB, CW &ge; -15 dB, FT8 &ge; -21 dB, WSPR &ge; -28 dB.
Predictions update every 3 hours with current solar conditions.*

## About This Site

Ham Stats is generated every 3 hours from a self-hosted ClickHouse database
containing **13+ billion** amateur radio propagation observations — the largest
curated dataset of its kind on Earth. No cloud services. No third-party APIs.
Every query runs against data we collected and maintain.

The data comes from four independent networks, each measuring a different layer
of HF propagation:

{% set wspr_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "WSPR") | first | default({}) %}
{% set rbn_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "RBN") | first | default({}) %}
{% set pskr_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "PSK Reporter") | first | default({}) %}
{% set contest_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "Contest") | first | default({}) %}
- **WSPR** ({{ wspr_row.total_rows | fmt }} spots, 2008–present) — the SNR floor at minimum power
- **Reverse Beacon Network** ({{ rbn_row.total_rows | fmt }} spots, 2009–present) — CW/RTTY measured signals
- **PSK Reporter** ({{ pskr_row.total_rows | fmt }} spots, live since Feb 2026) — FT8/digital operational contacts
- **Contest Logs** ({{ contest_row.total_rows | fmt }} QSOs, 2005–present) — the SSB/RTTY ceiling at contest power

Solar indices (SFI, Kp, SSN) are joined at 3-hour resolution so every
propagation measurement has its solar context.

This site is a product of the [IONIS Project](https://github.com/IONIS-AI) —
the Ionospheric Neural Inference System.

*The logs were speaking for decades, but nobody was listening. Now we're
listening — and we're publishing what we hear.*
