# Ham Stats

**HF propagation predictions trained on 13 billion real observations — not theory, not opinions.**

Ham Stats provides live HF propagation intelligence for amateur radio operators.
Everything on this site is derived from measured radio observations — WSPR beacons,
Reverse Beacon Network skimmers, PSK Reporter reception reports, and contest
QSOs — combined with real-time solar conditions from NOAA.

- **Predictions** — Which bands and modes can reach your target right now
- **Band Activity** — What's actually being heard across the HF spectrum
- **Solar Conditions** — Current SFI, Kp, and their impact on propagation
- **Historical Data** — Band-by-band trends, contest schedules, and DXpedition tracking

The predictions are powered by [IONIS](https://ionis-ai.com/) — a physics-constrained
neural network trained on the largest curated amateur radio propagation dataset on Earth.
For technical details on the model and methodology, see
[ionis-ai.com](https://ionis-ai.com/).

## What Can You Work Right Now?

??? info "How do these predictions work?"

    IONIS predicts the **ionospheric SNR floor** for a given path — it has no concept
    of your station, antenna, power, or receiver. It answers one question:
    *"Can the ionosphere support this path right now, and how much signal can it carry?"*

    The model considers five things:

    - **Where** are the two grid squares? (distance, azimuth, latitude, midpoint)
    - **When** is it? (hour of day, season, day/night geometry)
    - **What frequency?**
    - **What's the sun doing?** (Solar Flux Index &rarr; MUF lift)
    - **What's the magnetosphere doing?** (Kp index &rarr; storm penalty)

    From these inputs, the model outputs a predicted SNR in dB. That value is then
    matched against the minimum decode thresholds for each mode — SSB needs a
    strong signal (+3 dB), while WSPR can pull signals out of the noise floor (-28 dB).

    The model was trained on 13+ billion WSPR spots across thousands of stations
    with varying power levels and antennas. Because TX power is not a model input,
    these station differences become noise that the model averages over — what it
    learned is the ionosphere itself, not any particular operator's setup.

    The predictions represent a typical path — your actual results will vary with
    your antenna and power, but the path is either open or it isn't.

## About This Site

Ham Stats is generated every 3 hours from a self-hosted ClickHouse database
containing **13+ billion** amateur radio propagation observations — one of the
largest curated datasets of its kind. No cloud services. No third-party APIs.
Every query runs against data we collected and maintain.

The data comes from four independent networks, each measuring a different layer
of HF propagation:

{% set wspr_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "WSPR") | first | default({}) %}
{% set rbn_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "RBN") | first | default({}) %}
{% set pskr_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "PSK Reporter") | first | default({}) %}
{% set contest_row = data.bronze_status | selectattr("source_name", "equalto", "Contest") | first | default({}) %}
- **WSPR** ({{ wspr_row.total_rows | fmt }} spots, 2008–present) — the SNR floor at minimum power
- **Reverse Beacon Network** ({{ rbn_row.total_rows | fmt }} spots, 2009–present) — CW/RTTY measured signals
- **PSK Reporter** ({{ pskr_row.total_rows | fmt }} spots, live since Feb 2026) — FT8/digital operational contacts
- **Contest Logs** ({{ contest_row.total_rows | fmt }} QSOs, 2005–present) — the SSB/RTTY ceiling at contest power

Solar indices (SFI, Kp, SSN) are joined at 3-hour resolution so every
propagation measurement has its solar context.

This site is a product of the [IONIS Project](https://github.com/IONIS-AI) —
the Ionospheric Neural Inference System.

*The logs were speaking for decades, but nobody was listening. Now we're
listening — and we're publishing what we hear.*
