# Geographic Coverage

Coverage is measured in unique Maidenhead grid pairs (transmitter grid +
receiver grid). A grid pair with at least one spot means we have a measured
propagation sample for that path under some set of solar conditions. More
spots per pair means better characterization of that path across varying
conditions.

Grid squares are 4-character Maidenhead (e.g., EN52), giving approximately
111 km x 111 km resolution. There are 32,400 possible 4-character grid
squares globally.

Grid assignments are resolved via `wspr.callsign_grid` — a Rosetta Stone
table that maps callsigns to their most-used grid square, built from all
four source datasets. 3.89M verified operators, enriched with PSK Reporter
data which contributed the majority of grid assignments for callsigns not
active on WSPR.
