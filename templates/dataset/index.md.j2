# Dataset Overview

13+ billion amateur radio propagation observations. Four independent networks.
17 years of HF history. All solar-joined. All self-hosted.

This is one of the largest curated amateur radio propagation datasets of its kind. It did
not exist as a single queryable resource before this project. The data was
always there — scattered across wsprnet.org, the RBN archive, individual
contest log repositories, and pskreporter.info — but nobody had assembled it,
cleaned it, and joined it with solar indices at 3-hour resolution.

## What Makes This Dataset Unique

**Multi-source coverage of the full SNR dynamic range.** WSPR establishes
the propagation floor. RBN adds the skilled-operator layer. Contest logs
anchor the voice-workable ceiling. PSK Reporter fills in real-time digital
operational contacts. No existing public dataset combines all four.

**Solar context at measurement time.** Every spot has SFI, Kp, and SSN
attached from `solar.bronze` at the 3-hour bucket containing the measurement.
You can ask "what was the SNR on 20m when SFI was 180 and Kp was 3?" and get
real measured answers.

**Geographic resolution.** Maidenhead grid squares (4-character) give ~111 km
x ~111 km resolution globally. 8.3M unique grid pairs in WSPR alone — true
global coverage with density wherever amateur radio is active.

**No cloud dependencies.** All data is collected and stored on hardware we
own. No API rate limits, no subscription fees, no vendor lock-in.
