# RBN — Reverse Beacon Network

The Reverse Beacon Network uses software-defined radio receivers running
automated CW and RTTY decoders (skimmers) to report signals heard from
transmitting stations. Unlike WSPR, RBN spots real operators making real
contacts — a spot means a human operator sent a CQ or contest exchange that a
skimmer decoded with sufficient signal strength to copy.

RBN SNR represents what an automated receiver heard, not what a human ear
can copy. SNR values are in the 8–29 dB range for the bulk of spots, well
above the WSPR floor. This makes RBN the middle layer: above minimum-power
beacons, below the contest-grade SSB ceiling.

## Data Quality Notes

- Raw SNR range: up to 233 dB (skimmer AGC artifacts). `rbn.signatures`
  filters to -20 to 80 dB.
- 30M spots (2009–2010) have empty `tx_mode` — RBN was CW-only then.
  These spots are included in signatures as CW.
- 56.7M rows promoted to `rbn.signatures` after quality filtering and
  solar joining.
- DXpedition paths (rare, high-value paths) identified separately in
  `rbn.dxpedition_paths` and `rbn.dxpedition_signatures`.
