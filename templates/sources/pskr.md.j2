# PSK Reporter

PSK Reporter collects automatic reception reports from stations running digital
mode software (WSJT-X, JTDX, fldigi, and others). When a station decodes
an FT8, FT4, WSPR, or other digital transmission, the software silently
reports the reception to pskreporter.info. No operator action required.

The result is a near-real-time view of what digital operators are actually
hearing. At ~26 million spots per day, it is the highest-volume live feed in
the dataset. 88.7% of spots are FT8, with WSPR, FT4, and other modes making
up the remainder.

**Collection started February 10, 2026 via MQTT feed from pskreporter.info.
No historical bulk download exists — this data can only be collected forward.**

## Collection Method

Spots are collected via MQTT from `mqtt.pskreporter.info:1883`, an anonymous
public broker operated by Tom Sevart, M0LTE. The collector subscribes to the
`pskr/filter/v2/#` topic and receives all reported spots in real time. Output
is hourly-rotated gzip JSONL written to `/mnt/pskr-data/YYYY/MM/DD/`.

The `pskr-collector` service runs continuously on the 9975WX as a systemd
unit. Ingest to ClickHouse (`pskr.bronze`) runs hourly.

## How PSKR Differs from WSPR

PSK Reporter and WSPR capture different populations. WSPR reporters use
dedicated low-noise SDR receivers and run 24/7. PSK Reporter reporters are
FT8 operators who happen to have reception reporting enabled. The overlap in
spots is approximately 15% — these are genuinely different measurements of
different propagation activity.

PSK Reporter cannot capture SSB. For voice propagation, see
[Contest Logs](contest.md).

## Data Quality Notes

- SNR range: -34 to +38 dB observed. This is the operational digital range —
  above the WSPR floor, below the contest SSB ceiling.
- `t` (timestamp), `sc`/`rc` (callsigns), `sl`/`rl` (grids), `rp` (SNR),
  `f` (freq Hz), `md` (mode) are the primary fields from the MQTT JSON payload.
- Grid squares are Maidenhead 4-character or 6-character. 4-character grids
  are normalized for joining with other sources.
