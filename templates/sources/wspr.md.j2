# WSPR — Weak Signal Propagation Reporter

WSPR (pronounced "whisper") uses highly compressed digital transmissions at
roughly 200 mW to probe HF propagation paths. Stations transmit a 2-minute
beacon containing callsign, grid square, and power level. Receiving stations
decode these beacons and report the measured SNR to wsprnet.org.

Because WSPR uses such low power, a decoded spot means the path is open at the
propagation floor — not just open for high-power voice, but open enough to
carry a minimum-power digital signal. This makes it the most sensitive
propagation measurement in the dataset.

{% set stats = data.wspr_stats[0] if data.wspr_stats else {} %}
**{{ stats.total_rows | fmt }} spots. 18 years. One of the largest amateur radio propagation
datasets of its kind.**

## Band Breakdown

| Band | ADIF ID | Spots | Pct of Total |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|

{% else %}

{% endfor %}

*Band IDs are ADIF standard. Band assignment uses frequency-to-band lookup
(single source of truth in `bands.GetBand()`). Fixed as of v2.1.0 re-ingest
(2026-02-03) — all 10.8B rows carry correct ADIF IDs.*

## Data Quality Notes

- SNR range in raw data: -99 to +60 dB. Real WSPR is typically -30 to +20 dB.
- Ground-wave spots (< 500 km) are present in bronze but filtered from
  signatures to focus on ionospheric skip.
- Balloon/telemetry callsigns removed: 1,443 entries identified in
  `wspr.balloon_callsigns_v2`, covering ~950K spots (0.009% of bronze).
- 93.3M rows promoted to `wspr.signatures_v2_terrestrial` after quality
  filtering and solar joining.
