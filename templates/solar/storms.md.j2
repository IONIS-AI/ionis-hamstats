# Storm Impact Analysis

*Updated {{ now.strftime('%H:%M UTC %Y-%m-%d') }}*

This page shows measured SNR degradation during geomagnetic storms. All values
come from actual WSPR signal measurements joined against Kp index at daily
resolution.

A geomagnetic storm is defined here as Kp >= 5 (NOAA G1 or above). Consecutive
storm days are merged into a single event. SNR before/during/after is the median
across all recorded WSPR spots on each band during the respective window,
filtered to ionospheric paths (> 500 km).

## Recent Storm Events

| Storm Date (UTC) | Peak Kp | Classification |
|------------------|---------|----------------|
{% for row in data.storm_events %}
{% set storm_color = 'red' if row.peak_kp >= 7 else 'orange' if row.peak_kp >= 5 else 'ffea00' %}
| {{ row.storm_date | fmt_date }} | {{ row.peak_kp }} | ![{{ row.classification }}](https://img.shields.io/badge/{{ row.classification | replace(' ', '_') }}-{{ storm_color }}?style=flat-square) |

{% set snr_sample = data.storm_snr_comparison[0] %}
## SNR Before / During / After — Storm of {{ snr_sample.storm_date | fmt_date }} (Kp {{ snr_sample.peak_kp }})

*Median WSPR SNR (dB) on ionospheric paths (> 500 km) for the day before,
day of, and day after peak Kp.*

| Band | Before (dB) | During (dB) | After (dB) | Change | Recovery vs Baseline |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
{% for row in data.storm_snr_comparison %}
| {{ row.band_name }} | {{ row.before_snr | fmt_delta }} | {{ row.during_snr | fmt_delta }} | {{ row.after_snr | fmt_delta }} | {{ row.change_during | fmt_delta }} dB | {{ row.recovery_delta | fmt_delta }} dB |
{% endfor %}

*Change = During − Before (negative = degradation). Recovery vs Baseline =
After − Before (0 = full recovery, negative = still degraded).*
{% else %}
## SNR Before / During / After — Most Recent Storm

*No storms (Kp >= 5) recorded in the last 365 days.*

{% if data.storm_recovery %}
## Recovery Timeline

Hours after storm end until median WSPR SNR returns to within 1 dB of
pre-storm baseline, by band. Aggregated across all storms (Kp >= 5) in
the last 2 years. Consecutive storm days are merged into single events.

| Band | Median Recovery (hrs) | 90th Percentile (hrs) | Storm Count |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
{% for row in data.storm_recovery %}
| {{ row.band_name }} | {{ row.median_recovery_hours }} | {{ row.p90_recovery_hours }} | {{ row.storm_count }} |
{% endfor %}

*Recovery = first day post-storm where band median SNR is within 1 dB of the
day before the storm. Reported in hours (days × 24). Storms where SNR did not
recover within 7 days are excluded.*
{% else %}
## Recovery Timeline

*Insufficient storm data in the last 2 years to compute recovery statistics.*

## Storm Frequency by Year

| Year | Kp>=5 Days | Kp>=7 Days | Peak Kp | Cycle Phase |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
{% for row in data.storm_frequency_by_year %}
| {{ row.year }} | {{ row.kp5_events }} | {{ row.kp7_events }} | {{ row.peak_kp }} | {{ row.cycle_phase }} |
{% else %}
| — | — | — | — | — |
{% endfor %}

*Storm counts from `solar.bronze` (GFZ Potsdam historical data, backfilled
2000–present). Each row counts the number of days in that year where the
daily peak Kp reached the indicated threshold.*
