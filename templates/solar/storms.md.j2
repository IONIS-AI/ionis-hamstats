# Storm Impact Analysis

*Updated {{ now.strftime('%H:%M UTC %Y-%m-%d') }}*

This page shows measured SNR degradation during geomagnetic storms. All values
come from actual signal measurements — WSPR, RBN, and PSK Reporter spots
collected during storm events — joined against Kp index at 3-hour resolution.

A geomagnetic storm is defined here as Kp >= 5, sustained for at least 3 hours.
SNR before/during/after is the median across all recorded spots on each band
during the respective window.

## SNR Before / During / After — Most Recent Storm

*Median SNR (dB) measured from WSPR spots in the 24-hour window before,
during, and 24-hour window after peak Kp.*

| Band | Before (dB) | During (dB) | After (dB) | Change During | Recovery |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------|

*Coming soon — requires per-storm SNR comparison query.*

## Recovery Timeline

Hours after peak Kp until median SNR returns to within 1 dB of pre-storm
baseline, by band. Averaged across all storms in the dataset where Kp >= 5.

| Band | Median Recovery (hrs) | 90th Percentile (hrs) | Storm Count |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 10m | — | — | — |
| 15m | — | — | — |
| 20m | — | — | — |
| 40m | — | — | — |
| 80m | — | — | — |
| 160m | — | — | — |
