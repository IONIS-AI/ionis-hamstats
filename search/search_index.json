It answers one question: \"Can the ionosphere support this path right now, and how much signal can it carry?\"</p> <p>The model considers five things:</p> <ul> <li>Where are the two grid squares? (distance, azimuth, latitude, midpoint)</li> <li>When is it? (hour of day, season, day/night geometry)</li> <li>What frequency?</li> <li>What's the sun doing? (Solar Flux Index \u2192 MUF lift)</li> <li>What's the magnetosphere doing? (Kp index \u2192 storm penalty)</li> </ul> <p>From these inputs, the model outputs a predicted SNR in dB. That value is then matched against the minimum decode thresholds for each mode \u2014 SSB needs a strong signal (+3 dB), while WSPR can pull signals out of the noise floor (-28 dB).</p> <p>The model was trained on 14+ billion observations across thousands of stations with varying power levels and antennas. Because TX power is not a model input, these station differences become noise that the model averages over \u2014 what it learned is the ionosphere itself, not any particular operator's setup.</p> <p>The predictions represent a typical path \u2014 your actual results will vary with your antenna and power, but the path is either open or it isn't.</p> <p>IONIS predictions from KI7MT (DN13) for the current solar conditions (SFI 147, Kp 1.0).</p> Destination 10m 12m 15m 17m 20m 30m 40m 60m 80m 160m Europe (JN48) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 RTTY RTTY RTTY RTTY RTTY \u2014 \u2014 Japan (PM95) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 CW CW CW CW CW CW CW S.
